# All things Python

## Projects

- absp: [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) book.
Has pretty good review on Amazon and seems fun.

- [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/index.html#)
This seems more thorough and complex, goes into deeper details.

Both books have excercises, probably start with first one and then use second to go deeper and repeat material covered by first book.
