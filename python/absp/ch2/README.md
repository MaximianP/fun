# Chapter 2: Flow Control

## Questions / Problems

1. Enumerate the values a Boolean variable can have.

2. Which operator is used to compare:
  - two strings for equality
  - two numbers for non-equality
  - if one number is smaller than other
  - if one string comes alphabetically after another
  - if one number is smaller or equal than the other

3. Enumerate Boolean operators

4. What's the result of:
  - True and <any other value>
  - True or <any other value>
  - False and <any other value>
  - False or <any other value>
  - not True
  - not False

5. If `a` and `b` are boolean variables, write the truth table of
   the expression `a and not b`, i.e. complete this table:

    a  |  b  | Result |
   --- | --- | --- |
    True | True | ...| 
    True | False | ...
    False | True | ...
    False | False | ...
    
    How would you describe with your own words when the above expression
    evaluates to True?

6. Write a program that prompts user to enter two boolean
  variables `a` and `b` and prints the result of expression
  `a and not b`. Use this program to validate the Truth table
  from previous problem. Use an `if` statement.
  
7. Same as 6, but do not use an `if` statement.




Run some of the programs you wrote using built-in PyCharm
  debugger (set some breakpoints).
