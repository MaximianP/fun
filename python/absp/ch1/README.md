# Chapter 1: Python Basics

## Questions / Problems

Please put answer to every problem in a file named pN.txt (for problems that don't require
a program) or pN.py (for problems requiring a program).
Also answer teh *Practice Questions* at the end of the chapter - the
answers to those should be saved as qN.txt or qN.py. 

1. What are the operators for:
  - exponent
  - modulus/remainder
  - integer division/floored quotient
  - division
  - multiplication
  - subtraction
  - addition
  
2. What happens when you apply modulus to non-integer numbers?
   See what happens for:
   - 6.7 modulus 2.2
   - 6.6 modulus 2.2
     
3. See what happens when trying to use integer division on non-integer numbers:
   - 6.6 integer division 2.2
   - 6.6 integer division 2.0

4. Bottom line: never use operations for modulus and integer division
  on non-integers.
  
5. Describe each data type: which values and operations are allowed.

6. Describe legal variable names.

7. What will below program print?
```Python
x = 10
y = 2
x = y
y = y + 2
print(f"x={x}, y={y}")
```
  
8. Write a program that:
   a. asks user for her name
   b. asks user for her age
   c. prints how many years the user will be in 3 years

9. Python comments. Use program from 7/, ad comment out 3rd line.
   What does the program print?
   Useful PyCharm keyboard shortcut to comment / uncomment code: `Ctrl + /`

10. Write a program that prompts user to enter some text.
    Then print on the screen: "The text you've entered has N chars".
    (N should be substituted with text length)

11. Write a program that prompts the user for an integer number and
  then prints "The square of the number you entered is: ..."

12. Write a program that prompts the user for two integer numbers `a` and `b`
  and prints the `a modulus b`.
  
13. Write a program that prompts the user for two integer numbers `a` and `b`
  and prints the remainder of division `a` by `b`
  
14. Write a program that prompts the user for two float numbers `a` and `b`
  and prints "a divided by b is ..."
  
15. Enhance program from problem 14 so that if `b` is zero, then the program would
  print "Can't divide a by zero".

16. Write a program that reads two float numbers `a` and `b`, converts
  these numbers to integers and prints the remainder of division of `a` by `b`.

17. Write a program that reads two float numbers and prints "The numbers are equal" or
  "The numbers are not equal", depending on whether numbers are equal or not.

18. Write a program that reads two numbers `a` and `b` and prints
   `a` to the power `b`.

Run some of the programs you wrote using built-in PyCharm
  debugger (set some breakpoints).
