# Automate the Boring Stuff with Python

The book: [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)

Each chapter will have a dedicated directory, e.g. ch1 - for chapter 1.
chX/README.md will contain notes and small problems.

Create a new PyCharm project.
Specify as location: `~/fun/python/absp`. You'll get a message saying the directory is not empty - click Yes confirming that you'd like to create a project from existing sources.
